Fractol Project with MiniLibX Library
Introduction

Fractals are intricate geometric shapes that exhibit self-similarity and repeating patterns at different scales. This project aims to provide an interactive platform for visualizing various fractals, allowing users to zoom in, zoom out, and navigate around the fractal to observe its complex details.

The program is built using the MiniLibX library, which provides a basic set of graphical functions to interact with the X Window System. This makes it possible to create graphical interfaces, handle user input, and display images directly on the screen.

Features

Real-time rendering of multiple types of fractals.
Zoom in and out functionality to explore fractals in detail.
Color schemes to enhance visualization.
Interactive controls for user-friendly navigation.

Getting Started
Prerequisites
